This is an example app that:
* updates a file in a repo
* explicitly creates a check suite for that file
* creates a check run for that suite
* re-requests that check run

To see what events get fired, to run it you will need to configure `.env`, have a valid `key.pem` and insure you've got an installed GitHub app in a repo so that the installation id is correct. That's a bit of a pain.
